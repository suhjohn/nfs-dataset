# nfs-dataset

The below instructions setup remote environment in Cloudlab. The goal is to run a scripts keep pulling and automatically run new experiments.

1. Create long term dataset in Cloudlab. The dataset size can be sum(all 5 CDN traces + their annotated file).

2. Initialize experiment using this profile. Change the parameters as needed.

3. When ssh into nfs node, wait until pwd is `/proj/$PROJECT_NAME/workspaces/$USERNAME` and has finished executing the `init_home.sh` script.
   It takes about 10 minutes on average for this process to finish from the "Started" time on Cloudlab.

4. Run `./init_repo.sh`. At the end of the script(which approximately takes 6 minutes).

5. Add `export DBURI='mongodb+srv://dbUser:<password>@cluster0-jqnk0.mongodb.net/'` to the top of .bashrc
   (if appended at bottom, the export does not execute). John has the password.

6. Run the following script:
    ```
    cd ~/lrb
    script/git_pulling.sh > ~/git_pulling.log &
    disown

    ```
